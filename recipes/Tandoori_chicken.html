  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tandoori Chicken is a popular Indian dish known for its smoky flavor and vibrant red color.</P>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>4 large chicken leg quarters or 8 bone-in, skin-on chicken pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup plain yogurt (Greek yogurt works well)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil or melted ghee</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tandoori masala (store-bought or homemade)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika or Kashmiri red chili powder (for color)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro leaves, chopped (for garnish)</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges, for serving</li>
      </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Prepare the chicken:</strong> Wash the chicken pieces thoroughly and pat them dry with paper towels. Make deep cuts or gashes into the chicken pieces to allow the marinade to penetrate.</li>
          <li><strong>Marinate the chicken:</strong> In a large bowl, combine yogurt, lemon juice, vegetable oil or melted ghee, tandoori masala, ginger-garlic paste, ground cumin, ground coriander, paprika or Kashmiri red chili powder, turmeric powder, ground black pepper, ground cinnamon, ground cardamom, and salt. Mix everything well to form a smooth marinade.</li>
          <li><strong>Coat the chicken:</strong> Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are well coated on all sides. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or transfer the chicken and marinade to a zip-top plastic bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld and the chicken to tenderize.</li>
          <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). If you have a grill or barbecue, you can also cook the chicken over direct heat for a smokier flavor.</li>
          <li><strong>Cook the chicken:</strong> Place the marinated chicken pieces on a baking rack set over a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil (for easy cleanup). Bake the chicken in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the skin is charred in spots. Alternatively, if grilling, cook the chicken over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until cooked through and charred.</li>
          <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Remove the chicken from the oven or grill and let it rest for a few minutes. Garnish with chopped cilantro leaves and serve hot with lemon wedges on the side.</li>
        </ol>
