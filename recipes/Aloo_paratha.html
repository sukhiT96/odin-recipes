  <h2 class="recipe-heading">Steps</h2>
        <h3 class="step-heading">Making the dough</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, add whole wheat flour and salt. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Slowly add water little by little and knead into a smooth and soft dough. The dough should not be too hard or too soft. Cover the dough and let it rest for about 20-30 minutes.</li>
          </ol>
        <h3 class="step-heading">Making the potato filling</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>In another bowl, mix together mashed potatoes, chopped onions, green chilies, ginger-garlic paste, cumin seeds, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, salt, and chopped coriander leaves (if using). Mix everything well to make a uniform filling.</li>
          </ol>
        <h3 class="step-heading">Making the parathas</h3>
        <li>After the dough has rested, divide it into equal-sized portions and roll them into smooth balls.</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Take one dough ball, dust it with some flour, and roll it out into a small circle, about 4-5 inches in diameter.</li>
          <li>Place a portion of the potato filling in the center of the rolled-out dough circle.</li>
          <li>Bring the edges of the dough together and seal the filling inside, shaping it into a ball again.</li>
          <li>Dust the stuffed ball with flour and roll it out gently into a circle, about 6-7 inches in diameter. Be careful not to break the dough and let the filling come out.</li>
          <li>Heat a skillet or tawa over medium heat and place the rolled-out paratha on it.</li>
          <li>Cook until brown spots start to appear on one side, then flip the paratha and cook the other side.</li>
          <li>Apply ghee or oil on both sides while cooking until the paratha is golden brown and cooked evenly.</li>
          <li>Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls and potato filling to make more parathas.</li>
          <li>Serve hot with yogurt, pickle, or any chutney of your choice.</li>
        </ol>
